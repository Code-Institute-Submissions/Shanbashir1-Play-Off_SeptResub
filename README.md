# Project 2 - Play-Off - A Online Football Quiz Game
###  For my second project with Code Institue I will need to create a quiz game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Introduction
Play off will be multiple choice quiz game, the user will have 10 questions based on a Football event. The user will be displayed with 4 possible answers, in which they must select the correct answer. If the correct answer is selected the user will score a point of +1, if the user answer incorrectly than he will not receive any score. The user will be able to restart the quiz at the end of the game.

## User Stories
+ As a first time user I will need to know what the game is about and what type of question I should expect.
+ As a user I would need to be aware of the controls and functions of the game. 
+ As a user I would need to navigate through each question and be displayed my current score and the current question I am on. 
+ As a user I would need to be able to easily play the quiz game, through responsive design.
+ As a user I would need to restart the game if I have not succesfully answered all 10  questions correctly
+ As a user I would like to know about further games by registering my email address via the subscribe link.

## Features
