# Project 2 - Play-Off - A Online Football Quiz Game
###  For my second project with Code Institue I will need to create a quiz game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Introduction
Play off will be multiple choice quiz game, the user will have 10 questions based on a Football event. The user will be displayed with 4 possible answers, in which they must select the correct answer. If the correct answer is selected the user will score a point of +1, if the user answer incorrectly than he will not receive any score. The user will be able to restart the quiz at the end of the game.

## User Stories
+ As a first time user I will need to know what the game is about and what type of question I should expect.
+ As a user I would need to be aware of the controls and functions of the game. 
+ As a user I would need to navigate through each question and be displayed my current score and the current question I am on. 
+ As a user I would need to be able to easily play the quiz game, through responsive design.
+ As a user I would need to restart the game if I have not succesfully answered all 10  questions correctly
+ As a user I would like to know about further games by registering my email address via the subscribe link.

## Features 
### Header & Logo
+ The header logo will be displayed at the centre of the page on top of the game container.
+ The header will have a football icon displayed next to the text - this will be downloaded from Font Awesome.
+ The header will use a color code of #fff (white)
+ The header will be a be a fixed display throughout the content of the quiz game. 
+ <img src="/readme-images/header.png" alt = "Header" style="height: 100px; width: 900px;">

### Container for the Game (Main-box)
+ The Game container, which is referred to as the "main-box" within my HTML, will be the main container in which both questions and answer will be displayed. 
+ Within this feature, both the start and next button will be displayed for the user to select as they progress through the game. 
+ The user will also be present with a score tally and a question counter for them to be made aware of their progress, this will be located at the bottom of the container. The color font will be black, with clear visability for the user. 
+ The game container will be of a white background. 
+ The questions will be displayed at the top of the game container in standard text. 
+ The total number of questions will be 10 and will change as the user presses the "next button".
+ There will be a total of 4 multiple choice answers for the user to select. 3 of this questions will be "wrong" with 1 of the answers being "correct". If the user select's the incorrect answer than the color code will change and select the correct answer (light green) and highlight the incorrect answers as (lightpink).
+ The hover feature will be a color of red, advising the user of the selected answer. 

### Start, Next and Restart Button within the container. 
+ The start button will show on the main page with the welcome text, before commencing with the quiz
+ Once the strart button has been selected the start button will dissapear and the next button will show once the answer has been selected. 
+ The next button will only show once a answer has been selected. 
+ At the end of the game the user will have a option to restart the game with a "Restart Button"

### Footer 
+ The footer element will navigate the user to various social media pages.
+ "Follow us for new games available online" the following text will be above the social media links, to advise the user of our social media pages. The text will be a standard text format, with the colour of "white"
+ "Subscribe to our games newsletter" will be a standard text which will navigate the user to the subscribe email registration form. 
+ The form (SignUp) will be a link for the user to register using their email address. The form will acknowledge the users completed registration to the newsletter. 

## Future Features 
+ Audio, a possible future feature could be to introduce some background music, for the user to enjoy while working through the quiz.
+ Further Questions, I beleive with further questions the user would be able to enjoy the game and also to seek knowledge, to facts they were not actually aware of. 
+ Timer, a countdown was a feature I wanted to implement but I already had a question and score counter. However since designing the quiz game, I feel a game would benefit from a countdown timer. 
+ A animation feature of a football, to attract the user while playing the quiz. Animation always create a better design and user tend to enjoy while navigating. 

## Color Scheme



## Font Display



## Wireframes
+ For my wireframes I decided to design my initial design using Balsamiq.
+ The initial design want through various changes before I came to a final design with the prefered color contrast.
+ I understand my design will go through some changes as I go along, the design was created to give me some design feature and also a rough collection of the how the quiz game would be designed. 
+ Balsamiq was useful in putting together some of the features and how large I wanted to design the game container. The Button were also placed onto the wireframe to get a feel of the layout, prior to designing.

## Technology
For my second project JavaScript I was able to use a wide range of programes to implement my design. A list of the technology features and programes used are listed below, with methods of use.

+ HTML used to create the body structure and layout of the web page. The structure was designed using the coding language used for HTML.
+ CSS used to create the design and style feature to make the web page colourful and eye cathching for the user. The CSS was used in conjuction with the HTML structure.
+ JavaScript was used to create functions and implement the game. JavaScript is a programming language that is one of the coretechnologies of the world wide web Its is used alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript was able to create the quiz structure so that the user is able to play the quiz game.
+ GITHUB was used to create, host and deploy the web design on to the platform. The benefit of github was to create repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. Github was also a great way to share your design to mentors and other colleagues and tutors to help view your code and seek further input and support.
+ GITPOD Gitpod allows you to define your project's configuration in code so you can launch a prebuilt development environment with one click.(Source Google) Gitpod was used to code all my HTML and CSS coding.
+ Font Awesome Font Awesome was used to select icons to make the images relate to the headers. Font awesome added a attractive image to my page.
+ Balsamiq This was used to create the wireframes during the design phase of the project, initally my design was made on a notepad, until balsamiq was mentioned for use.
+ Google Fonts - This app was used to select the LATO and PT Serif fonts, however mid way into the project i decided to use Arial and Sans Serif though out the project.
+ Am I Responsive, this was used in order to see responsive design throughout the process and view different responsive designs.

## Testing - HTML AND CSS Testing
+ Lighthouse - Lighthouse Test I tested via the Google Developer Lighthouse check. Below is a screenshot of my results.


+ The W3C Markup Validation Service https://validator.w3.org The HMTL coding was checked via W3 validator, My check revealed I had no errors or warnings
<img src="/readme-images/w3Html.png" alt = "W3 Validator HTML" style="height: 400px; width: 700px;">

+ The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw The CSS code was check via The W3C CSS Validation Service - Jigsaw https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/. My check revealed I had no errors or warnings
<img src="/readme-images/W3css.png" alt = "W3 Jigsaw CSS" style="height: 400px; width: 700px;">



+ Chrome Stimulator The app was used to test the website on different browsers and devices. Test were operated repeatedly during all devleopment stages.

+ Supported browsers and platforms Google Chrome (latest version) — Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android Mozilla Firefox (latest version) — Windows

## Testing - JavaScript 
+ Jshint 

<img src="/readme-images/jshint.png" alt = "JShint " style="height: 600px; width: 800px;">

## Test Cases



## Fixed Bugs
+ Spacing for HTML & CSS - after chekcing my coding for both HTML and CSS I realised I had unnecessary spacing. These were deleated and the structure made tidy for viewing.
+ Media Screen Sizes - I realised that my media screen sizes were not displaying the correct layout for mobile devices. These were fixed and checked via Am I responsive app and the google developer tool.
+ After testing on Jshint - mycode had various missing semicolons, which were fixed. 

## Unfixed Bugs
There was no unfixed bugs by the time this was written.

## Deployment
### GITHUB
+ To deploy pages to Github the following steps were taken.

+ Login into your GITHUB account if you do not have one, you will need to create one
+ Find Repository button and open page
+ Locate the setting button and then locate the pages button.
+ You will then need to click the source button, on the tab labelled "none" select "main"
+ Once "main" has been selected the page will start to deploy, this will take a few minutes to deploy.
+ Once the link turns green, your link will be deployed.

### GITPOD
+ Some useful feature and pathways to note for Gitpod are as follows open pre-design of webpage(browser) "python3 -m http.server".
+ To save work git add .
+ To commit git commit -m TYPE MESSAGE i.e "added image to front page"
push your work to GITHUB repositories git push.
